* I recommend you to install **Git Bash** and set is as current terminal in your code editor.  
Step 1: Create a new Directory in your code editor.  
--> Set is as the current directory, using command :  
`$ cd "path of directory"`  
Step 2: **Clone** the repositry to your local code editor. Using command:  
$ git clone `"url of my repo"`  
Step 3: Install all the packages using the command:  
`$ npm install`  
Now, run the file *index.js* using command:  
i) If nodemon isn't installed in your system use,
`node index.js`  
        (or)  
ii)If nodemon is already installed use the command:
`nodemon index.js`
